  This change adds a new `compress` option to the config field and enables it by default.
  Prior to this change, compression was not enabled by default.
  The only way to enable compression prior to this change was via the DSN URL.
  With this change, `lz4` compression will be enabled by default.
  The list of valid options is provided by the underlying `clickhouse-go` driver.
  While this change is marked as breaking, there should be no effect to existing deployments by enabling compression.
  Compression should improve network performance on most deployments that have a remote ClickHouse server.
